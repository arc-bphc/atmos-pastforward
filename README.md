## Milestones:

* Done and dusted. ðŸ˜Ž


## Contributing

We love contributions. That out of the way, an average
contribution would involve the following:

1. Fork this repository in your account.
2. Clone it on your local machine.
3. Add a new remote using `git remote add upstream https://github.com/arc-bphc/atmos-pastforward.git`.
4. Create a new feature branch with `git checkout -b my-feature`.
5. Make your changes.
6. Commit your changes.
7. Rebase your commits with `upstream/master`:
  - `git checkout master`
  - `git fetch upstream master`
  - `git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD`
  - `git checkout my-feature`
  - `git rebase master`
8. Resolve any merge conflicts, and then push the branch with `git push origin my-feature`.
9. Create a Pull Request detailing the changes you made and wait for review/merge.

It might seem a little complicated at a glance, but the fundamental concept is simple: we
want to ensure that your changes are always made on top of the latest changes to the
project and thus, we can easily merge your code. If you are facing any troubles, create a
PR as you usually would and we would merge it manually. :)

### Commit Message Guidelines

The commit message:

- is written in the imperative (e.g., "Fix ...", "Add ...")
- is kept short, while concisely explaining what the commit does.
- is clear about what part of the code is affected -- often by prefixing with the name of the subsystem and a colon, like "server: ..." or "docs: ...".
- is a complete sentence, ending with a period.
